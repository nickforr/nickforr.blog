      <description>A combination of:
 re-reading a blog by @drob encouraging aspiring data scientists to write a blog, and
 a desire to have more people where I work writing and communicating technical ideas both to colleagues and externally
  led me to revisit this site, something I first started about a year ago (I thought I should perhaps practice what I&amp;rsquo;m preaching).
One thing I was struggling with was a name for the site, when I remembered an article titled &amp;lsquo;Rise of the Neo-Generalist&amp;rsquo; that I&amp;rsquo;d come across whilst researching for a talk I had to give (the talk was about future opportunities for actuarial1 skillsets).</description>

      <description>I grew up in Fife and now live on the outskirts of Glasgow. And maybe it’s just the ‘lovely’ July weather we’ve been experiencing, or maybe it’s just that I’m getting older and have a selective memory for the past, but I don’t recall summers being quite so wet when I was growing up!
I thought I’d take the opportunity to explore the data and play around with some visualisation…</description>

      <description>Another brief post in order to test whether the setup for continuous integration through Travis is working properly.
Some helpful links that I relied on to set everything up:

      <description>This is just a quick check to see if I can easily add posts to this blog using blogdown.
With a lack of imagination, I’m using the mtcars data set and ggplot (via tidyverse) to check it’s working ok (using viridis for colours).
library(tidyverse) library(viridis) mtcars %&amp;gt;% ggplot() + theme_bw() + geom_point(aes(x = disp, y = hp, colour = mpg)) + scale_color_viridis() + facet_wrap(~gear) + theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = &amp;quot;transparent&amp;quot;)) </description>
