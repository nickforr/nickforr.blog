      <description>I was tidying up some R code that involved some ‘looping’ and wondered whether the approach I’d taken could be improved uppon (I’d had nagging doubts over the approach but it worked and seemed fast enough, so hadn’t bothered refactoring it until now).
Background is that at work we use a lot of monte carlo simulations through economic scenario generators [https://www.actuaries.org.uk/learn-develop/attend-event/economic-scenario-generators] and so are dealing with matrices with dimensions representing timesteps (for projecting, for example, interest rates) and simulations.</description>
