Inspired by yet another @hrbrmstr project, I thought I'd have a go at replicating his approach for assessing the sentiment of a book, but using Homer's Iliad.

```{r}
library(hrbrthemes)
library(stringi)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
```

I've also used Project Gutenberg to access the text. I've removed the introductory text and just saved the file at the start of Book 1.

```{r}
iliad_txt <- stri_read_lines(file.path(getwd(), "iliad.txt"))
```
