A combination of:

- re-reading a [blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) by [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob) encouraging aspiring data scientists to write a blog, and

- a desire to have more people where I [work](https://www.hymans.co.uk) writing and communicating technical ideas both to colleagues and externally

led me to revisit this site, something I first started about a year ago (I thought I should perhaps practice what I'm preaching).

One thing I was struggling with was a name for the site, when I remembered an article titled ['Rise of the Neo-Generalist'](https://medium.com/startup-grind/the-rise-of-the-neo-generalist-5da52116b743) that I'd come across whilst researching for a talk I had to give (the talk was about future opportunities for actuarial[^1] skillsets). 

[^1]: Disclaimer, I'm not an actuary.

One particular paragraph in the article stood out for me, possibly justifying my own restlessness in seeking out new areas to explore.

> The neo-generalist defies easy classification. They are tricksters who traverse multiple domains, living between categories and labels. Encompassing rather than rejecting, the neo-generalist is both specialist and generalist. **A restless multidisciplinarian who is forever learning.** They bring together diverse people, synthesising ideas and practice, addressing the big issues that confront us in order to shape a better future.

And so I thought I would use that term for this site...
